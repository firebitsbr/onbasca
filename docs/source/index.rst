============

Tor bandwidth authorities run bandwidth scanners to measure the relays capacity
in the Tor network. They send their results to the directory authorities,
which use them to calculate the bandwidth weights of the relays,
what influences how the paths between relays and built.

The bandwidth scanners play and important role on the performance and
security of the Tor network.

This project aims at improving the current bandwidth scanner implementation
and research on the current issues in the network related to
bandwidth measurements and weights.

The bandwidth scanner being improved is ``sbws``:

- `sbws <https://sbws.readthedocs.io/>`_ documentation
- `sbws code <https://gitweb.torproject.org/sbws.git>`_
- `sbws issues <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?component=Core+Tor%2Fsbws&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=changetime&report=68&order=priority>`_

The improvements on core-Tor:

- `tor code <https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git>`_
- `bandwidth related tor tickets <https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/query?keywords=~bwauth&or&keywords=~dir-bwauth&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&col=component&order=priority>`_

**This site** compiles information related to bandwidth in Tor, the current status
and the improvements, but the main documentation is on the Websites
of the software being improved.
