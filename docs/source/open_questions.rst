Open questions (Mar 2018)
===========================



- do we want relays under our control to use for the measurements?
- algorithm to choose exits?
- location of the scanners?
- location of the Web servers?
- how to increase network diversity?
- how to distribute better network load around the world?
- what balance do we want between optimizing performance and maintaining network security?
- can we use Conflux or something like this? it could be a DDoS against the new relays. this could be done selectively against those relays with the unmeasured flag.
- if we measure the same relay 10 times, what should we do to combine these numbers?
- how important is it to keep the slow relays in the network? what does pushing them out do to network diversity?
- what balance do we want between optimizing performance and maintaining network security?
- “proof of storage” protocol, which delegates the bandwidth measurements to little relays, which run in aggregate to measure bigger relays
- peerflow
