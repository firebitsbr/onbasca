To rebuild these python files from the antlr3 grammar (JavaScript.g),
you need to download the antlr toolset jar (not the runtime):

wget http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.1.3.jar

You can then run it with

java -cp antlr-3.1.3.jar org.antlr.Tool -o . JavaScript.g

A new version of the Python antlr runtime (currently at 3.1.3), can 
be downloaded from http://www.antlr.org/download/Python/
